##### Insert your robot's MAC ADDRESS here ####
## (you can get it by running your arduino and looking at the serial monitor for your flying drone) ##
ROBOT_MAC = "DC:DA:0C:57:4B:94" # "DC:54:75:D7:B3:E8"
### Insert your SERIAL PORT here ###
## may look like "COM5" in windows or "/dev/tty.usbmodem14301" in mac  #
## look in arduino for the port that your specific transeiver is connected to  ##
## Note: make sure that your serial monitor is OFF in arduino or else you will get "access is denied" error. ##
SERIAL_PORT = "COM12"
